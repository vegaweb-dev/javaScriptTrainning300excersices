# JavaScript Training Exercises

This repository contains a growing collection of JavaScript practice exercises created as part of my continuous learning process. Each file focuses on a single concept, written in a clear and structured way to build strong programming foundations.

> The project is **in progress** — new exercises are added regularly.

## 📁 File Naming Convention

Each file follows this format:  
`NN-description.js`  
Where:
- `NN` is the exercise number (padded with zeros for sorting)
- `description` summarizes the logic of the file
